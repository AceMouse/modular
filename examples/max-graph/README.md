# Basic example for MAX Graph API in Python

This is an example of building a model with the MAX Graph API in Python and
execute it with MAX Engine.

For more explanation about this code, see the tutorial to [Get started with MAX
Graph in
Python](https://docs.modular.com/max/tutorials/get-started-with-max-graph-in-python).

## Usage

If you don't have it, install `pixi`:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh
```

Then navigate to this directory and run the example:

```sh
pixi run addition
```

You should see the following output:

```output
input names are:
name: input0, shape: [1], dtype: DType.float32
name: input1, shape: [1], dtype: DType.float32
result: [2.]
```
