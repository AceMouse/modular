"""Implements ops used when staging a graph.

Although the following modules provide a lot of the ops you want when building
a graph, you can also use functions in
[`Graph`](/max/api/python/graph/graph/Graph) to add constant values,
such as [`constant()`](/max/api/python/graph/graph/Graph#constant),
[`vector()`](/max/api/python/graph/graph/Graph#vector), and
[`scalar()`](/max/api/python/graph/graph/Graph#scalar).

The [`TensorValue`](/max/api/python/graph/value/TensorValue) type (returned
by most ops) also implements various dunder methods to support operations
between TensorValues, such as `+` add, `*` multiply, and `@` matmul, plus
convenience methods such as
[`reshape()`](/max/api/python/graph/value/TensorValue#reshape) and
[`swapaxes()`](/max/api/python/graph/value/TensorValue#swapaxes).
